# Optimization-of-3D-CCSPP
Multi-objective optimization of the 3D container stowage planning problem in a barge convoy system

# Description of the problem
the 3D - barge Convoy Container Stowage Planning Problem (3D-CCSPP) is a new and effective variant of the Container Stowage Planning Problems (CSPP) which is widely encountered in real-life situations of inland waterway freight transportation.
